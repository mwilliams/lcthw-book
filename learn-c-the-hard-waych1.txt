Chapter 1
Exercise 0: The Setup

   In this chapter you get your system setup to do C programming. The good
   news for anyone using Linux or Mac OSX is that you are on a system
   designed for programming in C. The authors of the C language were also
   instrumental in the creation of the Unix operating system, and both
   Linux and OSX are based on Unix. In fact, the install will be
   incredibly easy.

   I have some bad news for users of Windows: learning C on Windows is
   painful. You can write C code for Windows, that's not a problem. The
   problem is all of the libraries, functions, and tools are just a little
   "off" from everyone else in the C world. C came from Unix and is much
   easier on a Unix platform. It's just a fact of life that you'll have to
   accept I'm afraid.

   I wanted to get this bad news out right away so that you don't panic.
   I'm not saying to avoid Windows entirely. I am however saying that, if
   you want to have the easiest time learning C, then it's time to bust
   out some Unix and get dirty. This could also be really good for you,
   since knowing a little bit of Unix will also teach you some of the
   idioms of C programming and expand your skills.

   This also means that for everyone you'll be using the command line.
   Yep, I said it. You've gotta get in there and type commands at the
   computer. Don't be afraid though because I'll be telling you what to
   type and what it should look like, so you'll actually be learning quite
   a few mind expanding skills at the same time.

1.1 Linux

   On most Linux systems you just have to install a few packages. For
   Debian based systems, like Ubuntu you should just have to install a few
   things using these commands:
     __________________________________________________________________

   Source 1: Installing Requirements On Ubuntu
   1$ sudo apt-get install build-essential
     __________________________________________________________________

   The above is an example of a command line prompt, so to get to where
   you can run that, find your "Terminal" program and run it first. Then
   you'll get a shell prompt similar to the '$' above and can type that
   command into it. Do not type the '$', just the stuff after it.

   Here's how you would install the same setup on an RPM based Linux like
   Fedora:
     __________________________________________________________________

   Source 2: Installing Requirements On Fedora
   1$ su -c "yum groupinstall development-tools"
     __________________________________________________________________

   Once you've run that, you should be able to do the first Exercise in
   this book and it'll work. If not then let me know.

1.2 Mac OSX

   On Mac OSX the install is even easier. First, you'll need to either
   download the latest XCode from Apple, or find your install DVD and
   install it from there. The download will be massive and could take
   forever, so I recommend installing from the DVD. Also, search online
   for "installing xcode" for instructions on how to do it.

   Once you're done installing XCode, and probably restarting your
   computer if it didn't make you do that, you can go find your Terminal
   program and get it put into your Dock. You'll be using Terminal a lot
   in the book, so it's good to put it in a handy location.

1.3 Windows

   For Windows users I'll show you how to get a basic Ubuntu Linux system
   up and running in a virtual machine so that you can still do all of my
   exercises, but avoid all the painful Windows installation problems.

   ... have to figure this one out.

1.4 Text Editor

   The choice of text editor for a programmer is a tough one. For
   beginners I tell them to just use Gedit since it's simple and works for
   code. However, it doesn't work in certain internationalized situations,
   and chances are you already have a favorite text editor if you've been
   programming for a while.

   With this in mind, I want you to try out a few of the standard
   programmer text editors for your platform and then stick with the one
   that you like best. If you've been using GEdit and like it then stick
   with it. If you want to try something different, then try it out real
   quick and pick one.

   The most important thing is do not get stuck picking the perfect
   editor. Text editors all just kind of suck in odd ways. Just pick one,
   stick with it, and if you find something else you like try it out.
   Don't spend days on end configuring it and making it perfect.

   Some text editors to try out are:

    1. Gedit on Linux and OSX.
    2. TextWrangler on OSX.
    3. Nano which runs in Terminal and works nearly everywhere.
    4. Emacs and Emacs for OSX. Be prepared to do some learning though.
    5. Vim and MacVim

   There is probably a different editor for every person out there, but
   these are just a few of the free ones that I know work. Try a few out,
   and maybe some commercial ones until you find one that you like.

1.4.1 WARNING: Do Not Use An IDE

   An IDE, or "Integrated Development Environment" will turn you stupid.
   They are the worst tools if you want to be a good programmer because
   they hide what's going on from you, and your job is to know what's
   going on. They are useful if you're trying to get something done and
   the platform is designed around a particular IDE, but for learning to
   code C (and many other languages) they are pointless.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Note 1: IDEs and Guitar Tablature

   If you've played guitar then you know what tablature is, but for
   everyone else let me explain. In music there's an established notation
   called the "staff notation". It's a generic, very old, and universal
   way to write down what someone should play on an instrument. If you
   play piano this notation is fairly easy to use, since it was created
   mostly for piano and composers.

   Guitar however is a weird instrument that doesn't really work with
   notation, so guitarists have an alternative notation called
   "tablature". What tablature does is, rather than tell you the note to
   play, it tells you the fret and string you should play at that time.
   You could learn whole songs without ever knowing about a single thing
   you're playing. Many people do it this way, but if you want to know
   what you're playing, then tablature is pointless.

   It may be harder than tablature, but traditional notation tells you how
   to play the music rather than just how to play the guitar. With
   traditional notation I can walk over to a piano and play the same song.
   I can play it on a bass. I can put it into a computer and design whole
   scores around it. With tablature I can just play it on a guitar.

   IDEs are like tablature. Sure, you can code pretty quickly, but you can
   only code in that one language on that one platform. This is why
   companies love selling them to you. They know you're lazy, and since it
   only works on their platform they've got you locked in because you are
   lazy.

   The way you break the cycle is you suck it up and finally learn to code
   without an IDE. A plain editor, or a programmer's editor like Vim or
   Emacs, makes you work with the code. It's a little harder, but the end
   result is you can work with any code, on any computer, in any language,
   and you know what's going on.
