Chapter 23
Exercise 22: The Stack, Scope, And Globals

   The concept of "scope" seems to confuse quite a few people when they
   first start programming. Originally it came from the use of the system
   stack (which we lightly covered earlier) and how it was used to store
   temporary variables. In this exercise, we'll learn about scope by
   learning about how a stack data structure works, and then feeding that
   concept back in to how modern C does scoping.

   The real purpose of this exercise though is to learn where the hell
   things live in C. When someone doesn't grasp the concept of scope, it's
   almost always a failure in understanding where variables are created,
   exist, and die. Once you know where things are, the concept of scope
   becomes easier.

   This exercise will require three files:

   ex22.h
          A header file that sets up some external variables and some
          functions.

   ex22.c
          Not your main like normal, but instead a source file that will
          become a object file ex22.o which will have some functions and
          variables in it defined from ex22.h.

   ex22_main.c
          The actual main that will include the other two and demonstrate
          what they contain as well as other scope concepts.

23.0.2 ex22.h and ex22.c

   Your first step is to create your own header file named ex22.h which
   defines the functions and "extern" variables you need:
     __________________________________________________________________

   Source 58: ex22.h
   1  #ifndef _ex22_h
   2  #define _ex22_h
   3
   4  // makes THE_SIZE in ex22.c available to other .c files
   5  extern int THE_SIZE;
   6
   7  // gets and sets an internal static variable in ex22.c
   8  int get_age();
   9  void set_age(int age);
   10
   11  // updates a static variable that's inside update_ratio
   12  double update_ratio(double ratio);
   13
   14  void print_size();
   15
   16  #endif
     __________________________________________________________________

   The important thing to see is the use of extern int THE_SIZE, which
   I'll explain after you also create the matching ex22.c:
     __________________________________________________________________

   Source 59: ex22.c
   1  #include <stdio.h>
   2  #include "ex22.h"
   3  #include "dbg.h"
   4
   5  int THE_SIZE = 1000;
   6
   7  static int THE_AGE = 37;
   8
   9  int get_age()
   10  {
   11      return THE_AGE;
   12  }
   13
   14  void set_age(int age)
   15  {
   16      THE_AGE = age;
   17  }
   18
   19
   20  double update_ratio(double new_ratio)
   21  {
   22      static double ratio = 1.0;
   23
   24      double old_ratio = ratio;
   25      ratio = new_ratio;
   26
   27      return old_ratio;
   28  }
   29
   30  void print_size()
   31  {
   32      log_info("I think size is: %d", THE_SIZE);
   33  }
     __________________________________________________________________

   These two files introduce some new kinds of storage for variables:

   extern
          This keyword is a way to tell the compiler "the variable exists,
          but it's in another 'external' location". Typically this means
          that one .c file is going to use a variable that's been defined
          in another .c file. In this case, we're saying ex22.c has a
          variable THE_SIZE that will be accessed from ex22_main.c.

   static (file)
          This keyword is kind of the inverse of extern and says that the
          variable is only used in this .c file, and should not be
          available to other parts of the program. Keep in mind that
          static at the file level (as with THE_AGE here) is different
          than in other places.

   static (function)
          If you declare a variable in a function static, then that
          variable acts like a static defined in the file, but it's only
          accessible from that function. It's a way of creating constant
          state for a function, but in reality it's rarely used in modern
          C programming because they are hard to use with threads.

   In these two files then, you have the following variables and functions
   that you should understand:

   THE_SIZE
          This is the variable you declared extern that you'll play with
          from ex22_main.c.

   get_age and set_age
          These are taking the static variable THE_AGE, but exposing it to
          other parts of the program through functions. You couldn't
          access THE_AGE directly, but these functions can.

   update_ratio
          This takes a new ratio value, and returns the old one. It uses a
          function level static variable ratio to keep track of what the
          ratio currently is.

   print_size
          Prints out what ex22.c thinks THE_SIZE is currently.

23.0.3 ex22_main.c

   Once you have that file written, you can then make the main function
   which uses all of these and demonstrates some more scope conventions:
     __________________________________________________________________

   Source 60: ex22_main.c
   1  #include "ex22.h"
   2  #include "dbg.h"
   3
   4  const char *MY_NAME = "Zed A. Shaw";
   5
   6  void scope_demo(int count)
   7  {
   8      log_info("count is: %d", count);
   9
   10      if(count > 10) {
   11          int count = 100;  // BAD! BUGS!
   12
   13          log_info("count in this scope is %d", count);
   14      }
   15
   16      log_info("count is at exit: %d", count);
   17
   18      count = 3000;
   19
   20      log_info("count after assign: %d", count);
   21  }
   22
   23  int main(int argc, char *argv[])
   24  {
   25      // test out THE_AGE accessors
   26      log_info("My name: %s, age: %d", MY_NAME, get_age());
   27
   28      set_age(100);
   29
   30      log_info("My age is now: %d", get_age());
   31
   32      // test out THE_SIZE extern
   33      log_info("THE_SIZE is: %d", THE_SIZE);
   34      print_size();
   35
   36      THE_SIZE = 9;
   37
   38      log_info("THE SIZE is now: %d", THE_SIZE);
   39      print_size();
   40
   41      // test the ratio function static
   42      log_info("Ratio at first: %f", update_ratio(2.0));
   43      log_info("Ratio again: %f", update_ratio(10.0));
   44      log_info("Ratio once more: %f", update_ratio(300.0));
   45
   46      // test the scope demo
   47      int count = 4;
   48      scope_demo(count);
   49      scope_demo(count * 20);
   50
   51      log_info("count after calling scope_demo: %d", count);
   52
   53      return 0;
   54  }
     __________________________________________________________________

   I'll break this file down line-by-line, and as I do you should find
   each variable I mention and where it lives.

   ex22_main.c:4
          Making a const which stands for constant and is an alternative
          to using a define to create a constant variable.

   ex22_main.c:6
          A simple function that demonstrates more scope issues in a
          function.

   ex22_main.c:8
          Prints out the value of count as it is at the top of the
          function.

   ex22_main.c:10
          An if-statement that starts a new scope block, and then has
          another count variable in it. This version of count is actually
          a whole new variable. It's kind of like the if-statement started
          a new "mini function".

   ex22_main.c:11
          The count that is local to this block is actually different from
          the one in the function's parameter list. What what happens as
          we continue.

   ex22_main.c:13
          Prints it out so you can see it's actually 100 here, not what
          was passed to scope_demo.

   ex22_main.c:16
          Now for the freaky part. You have count in two places: the
          parameters to this function, and in the if-statement. The
          if-statement created a new block, so the count on line 11 does
          not impact the parameter with the same name. This line prints it
          out and you'll see that it prints the value of the parameter,
          not 100.

   ex22_main.c:18-20
          Then I set the parameter count to 3000 and print that out, which
          will demonstrate that you can change function parameters and
          they don't impact the caller's version of the variable.

   Make sure you trace through this function, but don't think that you
   understand scope quite yet. Just start to realize that if you make a
   variable inside a block (as in if-statements or while-loops), then
   those variables are new variables that exist only in that block. This
   is crucial to understand, and is also a source of many bugs. We'll
   address why you shouldn't do this shortly.

   The rest of the ex22_main.c then demonstrates all of these by
   manipulating and printing them out:

   ex22_main.c:26
          Prints out the current values of MY_NAME and gets THE_AGE from
          ex22.c using the accessor function get_age.

   ex22_main.c:27-30
          Uses set_age in ex22.c to change THE_AGE and then print it out.

   ex22_main.c:33-39
          Then I do the same thing to THE_SIZE from ex22.c, but this time
          I'm accessing it directly, and also demonstrating that it's
          actually changing in that file by printing it here and with
          print_size.

   ex22_main.c:42-44
          Show how the static variable ratio inside update_ratio is
          maintained between function calls.

   ex22_main.c:46-51
          Finally running scope_demo a few times so you can see the scope
          in action. Big thing to notice is that the local count variable
          remains unchanged. You must get that passing in a variable like
          this will not let you change it in the function. To do that you
          need our old friend the pointer. If you were to pass a pointer
          to this count, then the called function has the address of it
          and can change it.

   That explains what's going on in all of these files, but you should
   trace through them and make sure you know where everything is as you
   study it.

23.1 What You Should See

   This time, instead of using your Makefile I want you to build these two
   files manually so you can see how they are actually put together by the
   compiler. Here's what you should do and what you should see for output.
     __________________________________________________________________

     __________________________________________________________________

   Make sure you trace how each variable is changing and match it to the
   line that gets output. I'm using log_info from the dbg.h macros so you
   can get the exact line number where each variable is printed and find
   it in the files for tracing.

23.2 Scope, Stack, And Bugs

   If you've done this right you should now see many of the different ways
   you can place variables in your C code. You can use extern or access
   functions like get_age to create globals. You can make new variables
   inside any blocks, and they'll retain their own values until that block
   exits, leaving the outer variables alone. You also can pass a value to
   a function, and change the parameter but not change the caller's
   version of it.

   The most important thing to realize though is that all of this causes
   bugs. C's ability to place things in many places in your machine and
   then let you access it in those places means you get confused easily
   about where something lives. If you don't where it lives then there's a
   chance you'll not manage it properly.

   With that in mind, here's some rules to follow when writing C code so
   you avoid bugs related to the stack:

    1. Do not "shadow" a variable like I've done here with count in
       scope_demo. It leaves you open to subtle and hidden bugs where you
       think you're changing a value and you actually aren't.
    2. Avoid too many globals, especially if across multiple files. If you
       have to then use accessor functions like I've done with get_age.
       This doesn't apply to constants, since those are read-only. I'm
       talking about variables like THE_SIZE. If you want people to modify
       or set this, then make accessor functions.
    3. When in doubt, put it on the heap. Don't rely on the semantics of
       the stack or specialized locations and instead just create things
       with malloc.
    4. Don't use function static variables like I did in update_ratio.
       They're rarely useful and end up being a huge pain when you need to
       make your code concurrent in threads. They are also hard as hell to
       find compared to a well done global variable.
    5. Avoid reusing function parameters as it's confusing whether you're
       just reusing it or if you think you're changing the caller's
       version of it.

   As with all things, these rules can be broken when it's practical. In
   fact, I guarantee you'll run into code that breaks all of these rules
   and is perfectly fine. The constraints of different platforms makes it
   necessary sometimes.

23.3 How To Break It

   For this exercise, breaking the program involves trying to access or
   change things you can't:

    1. Try to directly access variables in ex22.c from ex22_main.c that
       you think you can't. For example, you can't get at ratio inside
       update_ratio? What if you had a pointer to it?
    2. Ditch the extern declaration in ex22.h to see what you get for
       errors or warnings.
    3. Add static or const specifiers to different variables and then try
       to change them.

23.4 Extra Credit

    1. Research the concept of "pass by value" vs. "pass by reference".
       Write an example of both.
    2. Use pointers to gain access to things you shouldn't have access to.
    3. Use valgrind to see what this kind of access looks like when you do
       it wrong.
    4. Write a recursive function that causes a stack overflow. Don't know
       what a recursive function is? Try calling scope_demo at the bottom
       of scope_demo itself so that it loops.
    5. Rewrite the Makefile so that it can build this.
