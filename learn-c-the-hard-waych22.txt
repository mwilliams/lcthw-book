Chapter 22
Exercise 21: Advanced Data Types And Flow Control

   This exercise will be a complete compendium of the available C data
   types and flow control structures you can use. It will work as a
   reference to complete your knowledge, and won't have any code for you
   to enter. I'll have you memorize some of the information by creating
   flash cards so you can get the important concepts solid in your mind.

   For this exercise to be useful, you should spend at least a week
   hammering the content and filling out all the element I have missing
   here. You'll be writing out what each one means, and then writing a
   program to confirm what you've researched.

22.1 Available Data Types

   int
          Stores a regular integer, defaulting to 32 bits in size.

   double
          Holds a large floating point number.

   float
          Holds a smaller floating point number.

   char
          Holds a single 1 byte character.

   void
          Indicates "no type" and used to say a function returns nothing,
          or a pointer has no type as in void *thing.

   enum
          Enumerated types, work as integers, convert to integers, but
          give you symbolic names for sets. Some compilers will warn you
          when you don't cover all elements of an enum in
          switch-statements.

22.1.1 Type Modifiers

   unsigned
          Changes the type so that it does not have negative numbers,
          giving you a larger upper bound but nothing lower than 0.

   signed
          Gives you negative and positive numbers, but halves your upper
          bound in exchange for the same lower bound negative.

   long
          Uses a larger storage for the type so that it can hold bigger
          numbers, usually doubling the current size.

   short
          Uses smaller storage for the type so it stores less, but takes
          half the space.

22.1.2 Type Qualifiers

   const
          Indicates the variable won't change after being initialized.

   volatile
          Indicates that all bets are off, and the compiler should leave
          this alone and try not to do any fancy optimizations to it. You
          usually only need this if you're doing really weird stuff to
          your variables.

   register
          Forces the compiler to keep this variable in a register, and the
          compiler can just ignore you. These days compilers are better at
          figuring out where to put variables, so only use this if you
          actually can measure it improving the speed.

22.1.3 Type Conversion

   C uses a sort of "stepped type promotion" mechanism, where it looks at
   two operands on either side of an expression, and promotes the smaller
   side to match the larger side before doing the operation. If one side
   of an expression is on this list, then the other side is converted to
   that type before the operation is done, and this goes in this order:

    1. long double
    2. double
    3. float
    4. int (but only char and short int);
    5. long

   If you find yourself trying to figure out how your conversions are
   working in an expression, then don't leave it to the compiler. Use
   explicit casting operations to make it exactly what you want. For
   example, if you have:

   long + char - int * double

   Rather than trying to figure out if it will be converted to double
   correctly, just use casts:

   (double)long - (double)char - (double)int * double

   Putting the type you want in parenthesis before the variable name is
   how you force it into the type you really need. The important thing
   though is always promote up, not down. Don't cast long into char unless
   you know what you're doing.

22.1.4 Type Sizes

   The stdint.h defines both a set of typdefs for exact sized integer
   types, as well as a set of macros for the sizes of all the types. This
   is easier to work with than the older limits.h since it is consistent.
   The types defined are:

   int8_t
          8 bit signed integer.

   uint8_t
          8 bit unsigned integer.

   int16_t
          16 bit signed integer.

   uint16_t
          16 bit unsigned integer.

   int32_t
          32 bit signed integer.

   uint32_t
          32 bit unsigned integer.

   int64_t
          64 bit signed integer.

   uint64_t
          64 bit unsigned integer.

   The pattern here is of the form (u)int(BITS)_t where a u is put in
   front to indicate "unsigned", then BITS is a number for the number of
   bits. This pattern is then repeated for macros that return the maximum
   values of these types:

   INTN_MAX
          Maximum positive number of the signed integer of bits N.

   INTN_MIN
          Minimum negative number of signed integer of bits N.

   UINTN_MAX
          Maximum positive number of unsigned integer of bits N. Since
          it's unsigned the minimum is 0 and can't have a negative value.

   There are also macros in stdint.h for sizes of the size_t type,
   integers large enough to hold pointers, and other handy size defining
   macros. Compilers have to at least have these, and then they can allow
   other larger types.

   Here is a full list should be in stdint.h:

   int_leastN_t
          holds at least N bits.

   uint_leastN_t
          holds at least N bits unsigned.

   INT_LEASTN_MAX
          max value of the matching leastN type.

   INT_LEASTN_MIN
          min value of the matching leastN type.

   UINT_LEASTN_MAX
          unsigned maximum of the matching N type.

   int_fastN_t
          similar to int_leastN_t but asking for the "fastest" with at
          least that precision.

   uint_fastN_t
          unsigned fastest least integer.

   INT_FASTN_MAX
          max value of the matching fastestN type.

   INT_FASTN_MIN
          min value of the matching fastestN type.

   UINT_FASTN_MAX
          unsigned max value of the matching fastestN type.

   intptr_t
          a signed integer large enough to hold a pointer.

   uintptr_t
          an unsigned integer large enough to hold a pointer.

   INTPTR_MAX
          max value of a intptr_t.

   INTPTR_MIN
          min value of a intptr_t.

   UINTPTR_MAX
          unsigned max value of a uintptr_t.

   intmax_t
          biggest number possible on that system.

   uintmax_t
          biggest unsigned number possible.

   INTMAX_MAX
          largest value for the biggest signed number.

   INTMAX_MIN
          smallest value for the biggest signed number.

   UINTMAX_MAX
          largest value for the biggest unsigned number.

   PTRDIFF_MIN
          minimum value of ptrdiff_t.

   PTRDIFF_MAX
          maximum value of ptrdiff_t.

   SIZE_MAX
          maximum of a size_t.

22.2 Available Operators

   This is a comprehensive list of all the operators you have in the C
   language. In this list, I'm indicating the following:

   (binary)
          The operator has a left and right: X + Y.

   (unary)
          The operator is on its own: -X.

   (prefix)
          The operator comes before the variable: ++X.

   (postfix)
          Usually the same as the (prefix) version, but placing it after
          gives it a different meaning: X++.

   (ternary)
          There's only one of these, so it's actually called the ternary
          but it means "three operands": X ? Y : Z.

22.2.1 Math Operators

   These are your basic math operations, plus I put () in with these since
   it calls a function and is close to a "math" operation.

   ()
          Function call.

   * (binary)
          multiply.

   /
          divide.

   + (binary)
          addition.

   + (unary)
          positive number.

   ++ (postfix)
          read, then increment.

   ++ (prefix)
          increment, then read.

   -- (postfix)
          read, then decrement.

   -- (prefix)
          decrement, then read.

   - (binary)
          subtract.

   - (unary)
          negative number.

22.2.2 Data Operators

   These are used to access data in different ways and forms.

   ->
          struct pointer access.

   .
          struct value access.

          [] Array index.

   sizeof
          size of a type or variable.

   & (unary)
          Address of.

   * (unary)
          Value of.

22.2.3 Logic Operators

   These handle testing equality and inequality of variables.

   !=
          does not equal.

   <
          less than.

   <=
          less than or equal.

   ==
          equal (not assignment).

   >
          greater than.

   >=
          greater than or equal.

22.2.4 Bit Operators

   These are more advanced and for shifting and modifying the raw bits in
   integers.

   & (binary)
          Bitwise and.

   <<
          Shift left.

   >>
          Shift right.

   ^
          bitwise xor (exclusive or).

   |
          bitwise or.

   ~
          compliment (flips all the bits).

22.2.5 Boolean Operators

   Used in truth testing. Study the ternary operator carefully, it is very
   handy.

   !
          not.

   &&
          and.

   ||
          or.

   ?:
          Ternary truth test, read X ? Y : Z as "if X then Y else Z".

22.2.6 Assignment Operators

   Compound assignment operators that assign a value, and/or perform an
   operation at the same time. Most of the above operations can also be
   combined into a compound assignment operator.

   =
          assign.

   %=
          modulus assign.

   &=
          bitwise and assign.

   *=
          multiply assign.

   +=
          plus assign.

   -=
          minus assign.

   /=
          divide assign.

   <<=
          shift left, assign.

   >>=
          shift right, assign.

   ^=
          bitwise xor, assign.

   |=
          bitwise or, assign.

22.3 Available Control Structures

   There's a few control structures you haven't encountered yet:

   do-while
          do { ... } while(X); First does the code in the block, then
          tests the X expression before exiting.

   break
          Put this in a loop, and it breaks out ending it early.

   continue
          Stops the body of a loop and jumps to the test so it can
          continue.

   goto
          Jumps to a spot in the code where you've placed a label:, and
          you've been using this in the dbg.h macros to go to the error:
          label.

22.3.1 Extra Credit

    1. Read stdint.h or a description of it and write out all the possible
       available size identifiers.
    2. Go through each item here and write out what it does in code.
       Research it so you know you got it right by looking it up online.
    3. Get this information solid as well by making flash cards and
       spending 15 minutes a day memorizing it.
    4. Create a program that prints out examples of each type and confirm
       that your research is right.
