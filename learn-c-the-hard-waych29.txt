Chapter 29
Exercise 28: Intermediate Makefiles

   In the next three Exercises you'll create a skeleton project directory
   to use in building your C programs later. This skeleton directory will
   be used in the rest of the book, and in this exercise I'll cover just
   the Makefile so you can understand it.

   The purpose of this structure is to make it easy to build medium sized
   programs without having to resort to configure tools. If done right you
   can get very far with just GNU make and some small shell scripts.

29.1 The Basic Project Structure

   The first thing to do is make a c-skeleton directory and then put a set
   of basic files and directories in it that many projects have. Here's my
   starter:
     __________________________________________________________________

   Source 78: Initial C Project Skeleton
   1  $ mkdir c-skeleton
   2  $ cd c-skeleton/
   3  $ touch LICENSE README.md Makefile
   4  $ mkdir bin src tests
   5  $ cp dbg.h src/   # this is from Ex20
   6  $ ls -l
   7  total 8
   8  -rw-r--r--  1 zedshaw  staff     0 Mar 31 16:38 LICENSE
   9  -rw-r--r--  1 zedshaw  staff  1168 Apr  1 17:00 Makefile
   10  -rw-r--r--  1 zedshaw  staff     0 Mar 31 16:38 README.md
   11  drwxr-xr-x  2 zedshaw  staff    68 Mar 31 16:38 bin
   12  drwxr-xr-x  2 zedshaw  staff    68 Apr  1 10:07 build
   13  drwxr-xr-x  3 zedshaw  staff   102 Apr  3 16:28 src
   14  drwxr-xr-x  2 zedshaw  staff    68 Mar 31 16:38 tests
   15  $ ls -l src
   16  total 8
   17  -rw-r--r--  1 zedshaw  staff  982 Apr  3 16:28 dbg.h
   18  $
     __________________________________________________________________

   At the end you see me do an ls -l so you can see the final results.

   Here's what each of these does:

   LICENSE
          If you release the source of your projects you'll want to
          include a license. If you don't though, the code is copyright by
          you and nobody has rights to it by default.

   README.md
          Basic instructions for using your project go here. It ends in
          .md so that it will be interpreted as markdown.

   Makefile
          The main build file for the project.

   bin/
          Where programs that users can run go. This is usually empty and
          the Makefile will create it if it's not there.

   build/
          Where libraries and other build artifacts go. Also empty and the
          Makefile will create it if it's not there.

   src/
          Where the source code goes, usually .c and .h files.

   tests/
          Where automated tests go.

   src/dbg.h
          I copied the dbg.h from Exercise 20 into src/ for later.

   I'll now break down each of the components of this skeleton project so
   you can understand how it works.

29.2 Makefile

   The first thing I'll cover is the Makefile because from that you can
   understand how everything else works. The Makefile in this exercise is
   much more detailed than ones you've used so far, so I'm going to break
   it down after you type it in:

     __________________________________________________________________

   Remember that you need to indent the Makefile consistently with tab
   characters. Your editor should know that and do the right thing, but if
   it doesn't then get a different text editor. No programmer should use
   an editor that fails at something so simple.

29.2.1 The Header

   This makefile is designed to build a library we'll be working on later
   and to do so reliably on almost any platform by using special features
   of GNU make. I'll break down each part in sections, starting with the
   header.

   Makefile:1
          These are the usual CFLAGS that you set in all of your projects,
          but with a few others that may be needed to build libraries. You
          may need to adjust these for different platforms. Notice the
          OPTFLAGS variable at the end which lets people augment the build
          options as needed.

   Makefile:2
          Options used when linking a library, and allows someone else to
          augment the linking options using the OPTLIBS variable.

   Makefile:3
          Setting an optional variable called PREFIX that will only have
          this value if the person running the Makefile didn't already
          give a PREFIX setting. That's what the ?= does.

   Makefile:5
          This fancy line of awesome dynamically creates the SOURCES
          variable by doing a wildcard search for all *.c files in the
          src/ directory. You have to give both src/**/*.c and src/*.c so
          that GNU make will include the files in src and also the ones
          below it.

   Makefile:6
          Once you have the list of source files, you can then use the
          patsubst to take the SOURCES list of *.c files and make a new
          list of all the object files. You do this by telling patsubst to
          change all %.c extensions to %.o and then those are assigned to
          OBJECTS.

   Makefile:8
          Using the wildcard again to find all the test source files for
          the unit tests. These are separate from the library's source
          files.

   Makefile:9
          Then using the same patsubst trick to dynamically get all the
          TEST targets. In this case I'm stripping away the .c extension
          so that a full program will be made with the same name.
          Previously I had replaced the .c with .o so an object file is
          created.

   Makefile:11
          Finally, we say the ultimate target is build/libYOUR_LIBRARY.a,
          which you will change to be whatever library you are actually
          trying to build.

   This completes the top of the Makefile, but I should explain what I
   mean by "lets people augment the build". When you run make you can do
   this:
     __________________________________________________________________

   Source 80: A Changing A Make Build
     # WARNING! Just a demonstration, won't really work right now.
     # this installs the library into /tmp
     $ make PREFIX=/tmp install
     # this tells it to add pthreads
     $ make OPTFLAGS=-pthread
     __________________________________________________________________

   If you pass in options that match the same kind of variables you have
   in your Makefile, then those will show up in your build. You can then
   use this to change how the Makefile runs. The first one alters the
   PREFIX so that it installs into /tmp instead. The second one sets
   OPTFLAGS so that the -pthread option is present.

29.2.2 The Target Build

   Continuing with the breakdown of the Makefile I have actually building
   the object files and targets:

   Makefile:14
          Remember that the first target is what make will run by default
          when no target is given. In this case it's called all: and it
          gives $(TARGET) tests as the targets to build. Look up at the
          TARGET variable and you see that's the library, so all: will
          first build the library. The tests target is then further down
          in the Makefile and builds the unit tests.

   Makefile:16
          Another target for making "developer builds" that introduces a
          technique for changing options for just one target. If I do a
          "dev build" I want the CFLAGS to include options like -Wextra
          that are useful for finding bugs. If you place them on the
          target line as options like this, then give another line that
          says the original target (in this case all) then it will change
          the options you set. I use this for setting different flags on
          different platforms that need it.

   Makefile:19
          Builds the TARGET library, whatever that is, and also uses the
          same trick from line 15 of giving a target with just options
          changes to alter them for this run. In this case I'm adding
          -fPIC just for the library build using the += syntax to add it
          on.

   Makefile:20
          Now the real target where I say first make the build directory,
          then compile all the OBJECTS.

   Makefile:21
          Runs the ar command which actually makes the TARGET. The syntax
          $@ $(OBJECTS) is a way of saying, "put the target for this
          Makefile source here and all the OBJECTS after that". In this
          case the $@ maps back to the $(TARGET) on line 19, which maps to
          build/libYOUR_LIBRARY.a. It seems like a lot to keep track of
          this indirection, and it can be, but once you get it working
          this means you just change TARGET at the top and build a whole
          new library.

   Makefile:22
          Finally, to make the library you run ranlib on the TARGET and
          it's built.

   Makefile:24-24
          This just makes the build/ or bin/ directories if they don't
          exist. This is then referenced from line 19 when it gives the
          build target to make sure the build/ directory is made.

   You now have all the stuff you need to build the software, so we'll
   create a way to build and run unit tests to do automated testing.

29.2.3 The Unit Tests

   C is different from other languages because it's easier to create one
   tiny little program for each thing you're testing. Some testing
   frameworks try to emulate the module concept other languages have and
   do dynamic loading, but this doesn't work well in C. It's also
   unnecessary because you can just make a single program that's run for
   each test instead.

   I'll cover this part of the Makefile, and then later you'll see the
   contents of the tests/ directory that make it actually work.

   Makefile:29
          If you have a target that's not "real", but there is a directory
          or file with that name, then you need to tag the target with
          .PHONY: so make will ignore the file and always run.

   Makefile:30
          I use the same trick for modifying the CFLAGS variable to add
          the TARGET to the build so that each of the test programs will
          be linked with the TARGET library. In this case it will add
          build/libYOUR_LIBRARY.a to the linking.

   Makefile:31
          Then I have the actual tests: target which depends on all the
          programs listed in the TESTS variable we created in the header.
          This one line actually says, "Make, use what you know about
          building programs and the current CFLAGS settings to build each
          program in TESTS."

   Makefile:32
          Finally, when all of the TESTS are built, there's a simple shell
          script I'll create later that knows how to run them all and
          report their output. This line actually runs it so you can see
          the test results.

   Makefile:34-35
          In order to be able to dynamically rerun the tests with Valgrind
          there's a valgrind: target that sets the right variable and runs
          itself again. This puts the valgrind logs into
          /tmp/valgrind-*.log so you can go look and see what might be
          going on. The tests/runtests.sh then knows to run the test
          programs under Valgrind when it sees this VALGRIND variable.

   For the unit testing to work you'll need to create a little shell
   script that knows how to run the programs. Go ahead and create this
   tests/runtests.sh script:
     __________________________________________________________________

   Source 81: tests/runtests.sh
   1  echo "Running unit tests:"
   2
   3  for i in tests/*_tests
   4  do
   5      if test -f $i
   6      then
   7          if $VALGRIND ./$i 2>> tests/tests.log
   8          then
   9              echo $i PASS
   10          else
   11              echo "ERROR in test $i: here's tests/tests.log"
   12              echo "------"
   13              tail tests/tests.log
   14              exit 1
   15          fi
   16      fi
   17  done
   18
   19  echo ""
     __________________________________________________________________

   I'll be using this later when I cover how unit tests work.

29.2.4 The Cleaner

   I now have fully working unit tests, so next up is making things clean
   when I need to reset everything.

   Makefile:38
          The clean: target starts things off whenever we need to clean up
          the project.

   Makefile:39-42
          This cleans out most of the junk that various compilers and
          tools leave behind. It also gets rid of the build/ directory and
          uses a trick at the end to cleanly erase the weird *.dSYM
          directories Apple's XCode leaves behind for debugging purposes.

   If you run into junk that you need to clean out, simply augment the
   list of things being deleted in this target.

29.2.5 The Install

   After that I'll need a way to install the project, and for a Makefile
   that's building a library I just need to put something in the common
   PREFIX directory, which is usually /usr/local/lib.

   Makefile:45
          This makes install: depend on the all: target so that when you
          run make install it will be sure to build everything.

   Makefile:46
          I then use the program install to create the target lib
          directory if it doesn't exist. In this case I'm trying to make
          the install as flexible as possible by using two variables that
          are conventions for installers. DESTDIR is handed to make by
          installers that do their builds in secure or odd locations to
          build packages. PREFIX is used when people want the project to
          be installed in someplace other than /usr/local.

   Makefile:47
          After that I'm just using install to actually install the
          library where it needs to go.

   The purpose of the install program is to make sure things have the
   right permissions set. When you run make install you usually have to do
   it as the root user, so the typical build process is
   make && sudo make install.

29.2.6 The Checker

   The very last part of this Makefile is a bonus that I include in my C
   projects to help me dig out any attempts to use the "bad" functions in
   C. Namely the string functions and other "unprotected buffer"
   functions.

   Makefile:50
          Sets a variable which is a big regex looking for bad functions
          like strcpy.

   Makefile:51
          The check: target so you can run a check whenever you need.

   Makefile:52
          Just a way to print a message, but doing @echo tells make to not
          print the command, just its output.

   Makefile:53
          Run the egrep command on the source files looking for any bad
          patterns. The || true at the end is a way to prevent make from
          thinking that egrep not finding things is a failure.

   When you run this it will have the odd effect that you'll get an error
   when there is nothing bad going on.

29.3 What You Should See

   I have two more exercises to go before I'm done building the project
   skeleton directory, but here's me testing out the features of the
   Makefile.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Source 82: Checking The Makefile
   1  $ make clean
   2  rm -rf build
   3  rm -f tests/tests.log
   4  find . -name "*.gc*" -exec rm {} \;

   6  $ make check
   7  Files with potentially dangerous functions.

   36  make[1]: *** [build/libYOUR_LIBRARY.a] Error 1
   37  make: *** [valgrind] Error 2
   38  $
     __________________________________________________________________

   When I run the clean: target that works, but because I don't have any
   source files in the src/ directory none of the other commands really
   work. I'll finish that up in the next exercises.

29.4 Extra Credit

    1. Try to get the Makefile to actually work by putting a source and
       header file in src/ and making the library. You shouldn't need a
       main function in the source file.
    2. Research what functions the check: target is looking for in the
       BADFUNCS regular expression it's using.
    3. If you don't do automated unit testing, then go read about it so
       you're prepared later.
